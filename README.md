# Library
First project
In this library automation system, as a user, you can perform operations such as borrowing books, returning books, loading balance, and searching for books.
In the admin panel, you can manage users' balances, view the people who have borrowed books, see the application from the user's perspective, add stock, and remove stock, among other operations.
